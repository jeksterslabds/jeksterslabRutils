## util_pkg_load

The `util_pkg_load` function
checks if packages in character vector are installed,
installs them if they are not currently installed,
and loads them.

## Use case

Typically,
packages are installed and loaded using the following code.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
packages <- c(
  "testthat",
  "devtools",
  "rmarkdown"
)
install.packages(packages)
library("testthat")
library("devtools")
library("rmarkdown")
```

Installing and loading libraries this way can be tedious
especially when the list of packages to install is long.
The package are also re-installed
even if they are already installed in the system.
This takes time.

The above task is executed with a single call below.
The function does more.
**If the packages are already installed,
the installation process is skipped
which is a great time saver.**
All the packages in vector are loaded in the namespace.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(jeksterslabRutils)
util_pkg_load(packages)
```
